I am a lazy weak-willed individual making this blog to stop being a lazy weak-willed individual. I have not achieved or done anything noteworthy in my life, and the way I am living my life I don't think I ever will. This blog is a way for me to change the status quo and for once being consistent and dedicated in life.
