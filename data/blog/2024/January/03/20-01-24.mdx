Writing this on 21 January.

I forgot when I woke up yesterday. Did not go to the gym yesterday wanted to rest my body for my body 2 days.

Yesterday I applied for jobs around 1 hour and coded for around 5-6 hours I guess.
Spent a lot of time looking for some otp service provider to handle otp authentication.

Also, lost a bet to my gym bro. He has not been coming to the gym for around 15 days. We were talking and I told him,
that I started lifting those 25kg dumbbells for chest press. Point to note is that he is stronger than me, since he is been going
to gym from way back, so I have already seen him do that. So, he was like nice nicee.

I asked him if he can do that right now, without any warm-up in one go. He said I guess. So, I bet a chicken burger, that he can't
do that. So, this conversation is of around 2:30pm something. So, we too entered the empty gym at 2:30pm for the bet.

Unfortunately for me, dude did 10 reps with 25kg dumbbells straight up without any warmup and me losttttttt 😭

So, that happened. Apart from that, nothing much, I want to get a good job so really been applying on that front. Hopefully something happens.

Bye then blog, let's get 21 Jan started now. Goal is to finish this app today. I've had enough of it. The coding is mostly done, it's the cumbersome
process of integrating and designing left that I need to tackle.
