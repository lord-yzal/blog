My words yesterday:
Bye then blog, let's get 21 Jan started now. Goal is to finish this app today. I've had enough of it. The coding is mostly done, it's the cumbersome
process of integrating and designing left that I need to tackle.

------------------------------------

So, I completed otp integration, but payment integration is left.
I think I coded for around 5 hours most of which was stuck on debugging nestjs/jwt exporting error.

Went to the library to study, there came a notification for opening in Japan. I selected it as my dream oppurtunity.
But friends are saying, it's not worth it with 24LPA (base not sure) and a service bond of 3 years.

All of the stuff is true, but also like if I get selected, new experiences and exposure.
And who's saying I am going selected already. Most probably TPO will reject my name from the opening. Let's see what happens.

That's all. Sayonara, blog 👋
