Yoii, so today I woke up around 7:30 am and went to gym at 7:40 am.
There I had a great session today. Finally able to pick 25kg dumbbells on incline chest press. Wohoooo 🕺🕺
Then trained my arms, biceps and triceps. Arms looked bigg after the workout, so noicee.

After that went straight for a bath, drank protein and ate 3 eggs. I do need to buy a new tray of eggs.

Then completed integration of admin dashboard and backend. Then for lunch, ate yellow rice disguised as Veg Biryani.
Also, one of my friend came back from his home today and he brought homemade kaju katli.

That was soooo good. Had to eat another!
After that me writing this in the afternoon. The other half I will write at night so that I do post the blog on the same day
and not leave it for tomorrow.

Now, me will go back to some coding.

Yoii, so soon after I received an assignment for a web developer internship. I think I worked for 3 hours on that.
Afterwards from 6:30pm to 7:30pm, I went out with my roomie to buy eggs.

Also ate pani puri and badam shake. Both were really great.
Afterwards, went to a shop to buy eggs. There what happened is that I gave my empty egg tray to him, thinking now it will take some time
since he will be placing eggs one by one. But instead, he just placed my empty tray over an already filled tray, and turned the tray upside down.

Then he just removed his tray from the top and gave me my tray now filled with 30 eggs. I was like woaah, I didn't think of that.
Afterwards, me writing this around 8pm and am thinking of sleeping for 1 hour and then working.
