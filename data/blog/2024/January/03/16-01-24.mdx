Yoii, so today I woke up around 8:30 am and went to gym at 8:40 am.
I went to the gym but noticed that if I start exercising now, everything will be pushed to 2-3 hours ahead, so
just checked my weight which came out to be 70kgs, I bought bananas, had a cup of tea and left 3 eggs to boiler.

My goal for the day was to integrate admin dashboard with the backend.
So, did that along with watching a success story of a indie game developer so that was cool.

After lunch, again sat down to code with some breaks in between.
After dinner, sat down to code but was listening to Champagne by Diljit Dosanjh and that made me
want to listen to the song while walking outside.

So I went out to walk but instead of that found some friends playing basketball and went to join them.
Unfortunately, I was able to put in a few baskets only and our team lost in 2v2, but playing was fun.

After that, came to my room and continued the integration.
Except orders page, I completed all the pages. So, tomorrow my goal will be to finish admin integration till 12,
and after that start integrating the app with the backend.

Pretty normal day, all things considered. Sayonara blog 👋
