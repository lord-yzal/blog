Writing this on 15th Jan.
Created a backlog file, because I missed yesterday's LEETCODE CONTEST...

Yesterday, sunday so rest day. Woke up around 8 and went to the canteen to eat Aloo Paratha while talking with family.
Afterwards, came back to room for coding and after half an hour in, moved to helping my brother set up his blog similar to mine.
That took us around 1.5 hours because of some damned bug that only occurred on his system.

Afterwards, I went to the library to finish the UI of the app. After defining the structures, took help of chatgpt to help me with
the designs and that worked out great. Then went for dinner and got meself Paneer Makhanwala and Paneer Malwani. I think it was a nice
decision to forgo lunch to buy 2 dishes at the mess. The taste was really good.

After that I was on duolingo for around half hour, doing exercise after exercise.

After that showed the app's UI to my friend and got some good suggestions to work on. I do need to make some UI changes but will
only do that when I get the app working now.

Yeah that's all for yesterday. Byeeeo blog 👋
