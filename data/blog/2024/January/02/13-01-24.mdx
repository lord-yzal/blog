Yo, today I woke up around 7 and went to grab milk, but voila, there was no milk there at the gate
because my VIP subscription trial ended. It's such a scam, with the VIP subscription the packet of milk
costs around Rs 29 but without it, the cost shown in Rs 45.

And the VIP subscription itself is very costly. So, instead of using this app, I will be switching to
another one. So, after that I sat down to build the UI of the app that I was coding in react native.

When I was coding, my roomie came and ask me no gym today, and I was like nahh, need to do this.
Sooo, 10 minutes after this conversation, I went to the gym ü´£.

There had a noice chest, tricep and bicep session. I think one of the mirror does not show the real reflection,
as my arm looks really big when flexing in it. So, after gym and a bath, sat down to code now in peace.

My roomie once again came and told me to get ready to go shopping. I was like whaaa, then I remembered I gave my
word to go with him, and I did wanted to buy some trackpants for the gym. So, went me, my roomie and another friend went
for shopping.

It's great that the bus service, has started accepted UPI payments, makes life easier for students like us, who don't
go around taking cash with them only because all shops in our college use UPI only. It's a habit at this point.

Entering the city, we ditched the bus for auto, because dividing the fare by 3, is relatively cheaper and the ride is
faster and smoother. Also, you get seats, so that tooo.

First, we went to Decathlon and me bought meself trackpant and shorts. My roomie, whose idea was to go there only was disappointed,
because all pants at Decathlon are the same size, and all were very tall for him ü•≤

Fortunately, he and the other friend(let's call him 'binary') got themselves some nice jacket. After that went to pantaloons, was very costly, then to westend.There I was lured by the scheme of Buy 2 get 1 free. My friends were ready, but nothing was available in their size. So, I sadly went to buy for myself, which would have costed around Rs 700.

One T-shirt price was 700, so the plan was to buy one more so the total becomes, 1400. But since one was free, we were planning to
distribute the cost at 1400/3, which sounded reasonable but unfortunately, there sizes were out of stock.

So, as I went to the counter to pay Rs 700 for one, my roomie suggested to buy 2 only, so that I will get 3 Tees for myself.
It sounded great at the time but now I have 3 full sleeved T-shirts of the same type in diff colors. I guess it's alright. At the
time, it sounded great.

Moving on, we went to a restaurant nearby to eat Paneer and Mushroom, so alright.

We also drank lemonade at a roadside stall. On asking, he told me his profit is around Rs 1200 per day, that even in off-season.
So, the dude is doing great for himself.

After that we went to another shop to buy shirts. There after a lot of looking around got myself a yellow long kurta style shirt
for ethnic events. After that my roomie lost his token, which you get for storing bags, so he went and looked around here and there but couldn't find it.

Fortunately, we knew the contents of the bag, duh they wereee ours, and went on our merry way. After that, took a detour at one place to
get my beard all trimmed and nice. After drinking Coconut water, we reached our hostel at around 6:30pm. We had departed around 11:15am, so entire day went by roaming the shops and buying stuff. After that I just did some Duolingo, and daily problem on leetcode.

Then finally sat down to code the app. After half an hour of coding, I was in dreamland and am writing this blog on 14th of January üôÇ, hehe :)

So yeah, that's it pretty much. Later gator üëã
