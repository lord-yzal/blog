Heyy, just writing the entries for yesterday and today here only.

So, the 2 days were pretty generic. I did not go to the gym. It's not that I had
pain in my back, but I was just not feeling right in my back, so gave it a rest.

After that yesterday, I also skipped my breakfast eggs, ate lunch from mess and at night
went out and ate chicken mayonaisse roll because I was craving it. I also bought and drank 2 sweet lassi,
afterwards when my friend came to eat from my bucket of peanut butter and we got to talking did I notice that
one glass of that sweet lassi had around 24g of cholestrol and only around 4g of protein. And I had consumed 2 🙂.

So yeah, not going to buy that from now on. For today, I had nothing in the morning, kidney beans in the afternoon
and for dinner ate 4 eggs and milk with whey protein.

Both of the days, I worked for around 6-7 hours on eCommerce app and I think it will take up my entire week.
I really want to complete it in this week only, as my main priority right now should be problem solving only.

But the eCommerce app is good in that I am solving a real world problem, using practices used by software professionals
and not just half-assing stuff. So, great learnings in that.

Tomorrow I have a full body workout session planned with my gym bro. So, that will be intense. Looking forward to it.

Apart from that life is monotonous. Need to remove watching youtube shorts and add that time to study spanish or punjabi.

There are no good punjabi apps like duolingo. I think I should just go and build one. Something to look into later.

I think that's all for today. Sayonara blog/diary 👋
