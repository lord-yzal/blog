Yo, today I woke up around 7 and after getting milk and getting ready started gym at 7:30am.
Once again gym bro didn't come, because he was busy sleeping...smh

So, today I just hit legs and did some squats practicing my form. After that I did a lot of
lower back stretching and came back to room.

When I came back and opened duolingo, I saw they gave me premium for 3 days. With premium, you
can make as many legendary attempts which otherwise would have costed me 100gems which you have to collect.

So, I went all mad and earned meself a lot of legendary badges and reached number 1 on the weekly leaderboard, hehe.
My goal this week is to top the weekly leaderboards üò§

So after that, I went to bath and then went to grab goodies which my roomie's company got him for New Year.
It just had a nice steel water bottle and lot of chocolates. Since, the roomie is not here, the chocolates have transferred ownership.

So, after eating chocolates and watching some uncle roger's shorts on youtube I sat down to code.
All in all, I coded for around 5-6 hours, I think.

In the evening, ate Shahi Paneeeeer and and Paneer Makhanwala for dinner, so that was great.
While roaming around college after dinner, saw my gym bro in the basketball court doing shooting.

Went up to play 1v1 with him, which later turned to a 2-on-2 when 2 more people. Gym bro showed stellar performance
making a lot of 3 pointers leading us to have a effortless victory. I also shot some 3s, but I let him do all the work.
I didn't feel like moving much after a full stomach.

After that again sat down to code, and slept while coding, that's why writing this in the morning of 13 Jan.
That's all for now, blog/diary...
