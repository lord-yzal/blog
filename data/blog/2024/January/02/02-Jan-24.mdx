## Goals

1. React native eCommerce
2. Cohort up to date
3. Excel sheets for all the problems that I solved/attempted in the first week.

### Start of Week:

For this week ideally, I will use 3 days for eCommerce, 3 days for cohort and 1 day for any unforeseen circumstances.
I have decided that from this week onwards first I will attempt the daily problem, puzzle and sql query and only after that
start up on other things/tasks of the day.

### End of the week 
So, another week has passed by and unfortunately, I have not been able to complete a single one of my goals.
Sad state of affairs, but making the app is really taking a lot of time.

So, next week all these tasks only are getting carried over.

Notable events for this week were =>

Frontend UI of eCommerce app completed 
Went shopping, bought a buy 2 get 1 type deal, and friend lost his token
