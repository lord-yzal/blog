Writing this on 28 Jan.

27th Jan was one of my productive days. First of all in the gym had a nice back and biceps session.
Not great but nice. New gym bro is wide which makes me look small. I am tall + thin so need to get some width in.

Will come slowly I guess. Afterwards ate eggs and protein. Forgot to drink my milk the day before so drank that in the
morning too. Aftewards, packed my bag and went to the gym.

Then went to the library and tested the application that I've been working on for around 45 minutes.
Then, got a call to fetch items since my order of dry fruits came. Did that and after some time it was 12pm, so went for lunch.
Lunch was so-so, after which I went back to the library and went back to study.

Then worked for around 4 hours on the app. Finalised the app, its backend, the frontend and the admin part. Deployed the database and the backend and tested
an apk of the app on my mobile. Found some bugs and fixed them.

In the evening had a chat with my friend and showed my gym progress. It seems, my body has changed somewhat. Noicee!
On my way to becoming more stronger and sexier only. I made a bet with my brother that I would have a body like Siddhart Malhotra
when he was in Student of the Year. That even in less than a year. This was in my 12th class I thnk. Well, I was naive back then.

But I think being consistent, I'll be able to fullfill that in 2 years I guess. So something to look forward too.
Then talked about life and its problems. Life throws a lot of problems suddenly when you least expect them.

I do have the regret of not getting a good intern in college and not being able to do something for my parents and brother.
So, really need to study now to get a good job to get rich to get financial independence and also layoff-proof such that, even 
if the company I am working in lays me off for some reason, I should be good enough to get a job in another company.

I am not layoff proof currently. Need to work on that.  I guess that's all for 27th Jan. Adios blog üëã
