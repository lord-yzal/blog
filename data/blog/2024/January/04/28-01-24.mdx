Yo. So today, I did nothing except playing all day long.
First of all woke up around 7am and went to the gym with my roomie around 7:30am.
There just did some stretching exercises and abs only, because rest day.
This was for half an hour only. 

Then gathered classmates for a volleyball match. Played 4 volleyball matches. If you are playing for fun, you should definitely
get someone who's good at trash talk. Makes the game really interesting.
We lost the first one, then won the 3 afterwards 😤.
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

After that bought myself curd to make lassi drinking that I just went to sleep.
Woke up around 3pm and went to the library. There my friend emotionally blackmailed me to play in the inter branch college competition.
So I had to oblige him and went for the same.

From the last year the only physical activity I am doing is at max going to gym for 1 hour and sometimes playing badminton.
I have stopped running, as that really makes me lose all of my weight.

Today. Today, I had to run for 40minutes straight back and fro on the court. Worst we had a lead most of the game but
slowly lost it and finally lost the game.

After that ate some food, talked to my family for an hour and then now going to sleep.
I also completed rookie section Duolingo.

So, that was my day. Good night blog 👋
