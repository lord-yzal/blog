Today, woke up around 7:50am. Was in gym at 8:00am. Had a back and biceps workout.
No new breakthroughs. Just started wearing gloves to help me lift heavy on the lat pulldown.

My sweaty hands with calluses don't really allow me to go heavy, so need those glovesss.
After that came to my room and set up egg boiler with 4 eggs and then went for a bath.

Then while bathing got hard and again rubbed one out. Usually, I do have a lot of energy after gym,
so I don't masturbate because then it's a certainty, I will be up to no good then for the rest of the day
and it will become a cheat day.

But now that I broke my streak for the year, the floodgates have opened, and this shit happened again.

Yeah, so after that ate 4 eggs and a banana and after talking to my brother, I went to sleep.
Woke up at 2 and went to eat a cheesy corn roll and ate 2 ice cream back to back.

This is not how I want my year to go. I want this year to prove to myself that if I decide on something,
I keep my word and my goal for this year is to really work on myself from gym to problem-solving skills.
To have control on my mind. Like I have stopped using instagram before also. Ultimately, it does not make much
difference for my life. I just want to become comfortable with being bored and not resort to things like
insta, youtube, twitter or watching porn. I want a hard dopamine resetttttttt.

Hopefully, next time I remember these things before I take a premature decision and give in to my urges.
Too much rant for a single fap but habit builds character and all that shit ✌️

Yeah, so with that it's 4pm in the evening and now I guess, I will work with integrating face recognition to
my college project.

I coded for around 2.5 hours and then went for lunch. Afterwards, I wrote down all the new spanish words and
