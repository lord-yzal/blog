Today I woke up at 7am and immediately started working on my college project. I had to do this Yesterday, but
that became a cheat day and I just can't pull an all-nighter and do stuff. I'd rather wake up early and do stuff.

So, from 7am - 11am, worked on the project only preparing a web application to show. Many of the functionalities were
somehow not working when they should have (murphy's law in effect).
So, I had to go the another route and hard code some values 🤫 to make it look like everything is working properly.

Also, skipped my breakfast for that, but finally had something that could be presented and save our hide.

Went for the presentation which was scheduled at 11am, but was postponed to 4pm.
So, came back did some duolingo, went for lunch at 12, came back, scrolled linkedin and went to sleep.

Woke up at around 3 got ready and went for the presentation. I think presentation went well, with regards to the work we
had taken up to them. One professor really asked to show the code and explain the flow of the function being invoked.

Successfully bamboozled her somehow, going from file to file and showing small code snippets. For now we are safe. One
of these days, will have to sit down and complete the project.

Then went to the library and worked on the eCommerce app from 6 to 7pm.
After eating bad food at the mess, roamed a bit with friends and came back to room.

Then after some time went out again, and played basketball for some time, just shooting the ball in the basket.
That was relaxing. Afterwards, came back to my room, coded for 1 hour and watched one random gym video.

Then I watched another video of how apple has been fucking the developers over, by demanding 30% of revenue on all
digital products. And the developers are forced to use apple payment only otherwise their app will get banned.
That's why there's a large legal battle going on between Apple and Epic Games (makers of fortnite).

Yeah, so this happened. Going to sleep ab. Adios blog 👋
