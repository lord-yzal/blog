Today, woke up at 7am and went to gym at 7:10am. Different gym bro today, who woke me up.
Had a nice leg workout. First did normal squats for warmup, then leg press and bulgarian squats.
Practiced my form with barbell squats using only 7.5 kgs on each side. Ended the session with calf raises.

Going back to my room, saw my roomie looking for something to read and asked me for recommendation. Told him
to read Man's search for meaning. Felt very proud after recommending such a great book.

That made me remember all the books I used to borrow from my girlfriend and then discuss with her afterwards. Those were
good times. Nowadays, I don't feel like picking up a new book for now.

After that drank protein+water and went straight to study. I can finally say that payment integration is also finished.
Tomorrow I have a exam and afterwards a college presentation too. So, I will make final changes to the app on the weekend and 
show it next week.

Afterwards, I started preparing for my exam.
Also, recently I heard the song Gold Digger by Kanye West on Youtube and now can't take it out of my mind.
So, this song will be on loop for a week or two now.

Pretty normal and nice day. Oki then sayonara blog 👋
