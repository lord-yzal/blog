Writing this on 27 Jan.

26th of Jan was pretty lazy. First had a gym session from 7 to 8am. I have a new gym bro now, who lives in hostel only
and so can't make any excuses. He is usually more into bodyweight exercises and calisthenics but for now doing weights for now.

After a nice workout session, I bathed, ate eggs and protein drink and sat down to work. After half hour, the sun outside was
really calling me, so I with my roomies went out to get some sunlight. Sat down at bench and basked in the sunlight while talking
about random things. There met old gym bro too, who had come for a cricket match today.

After that went for lunch at 12. Today was republic day, so in mess we had puri, chole paneer and a (mix of gajar ka halwa + kheer) though it tasted
really good. Afterwards, ate an icecream too. 

Then just slept from 1 to 3pm. Then worked for around 1 hour and then with my roomies went out to drink fruit juice. After that sat down to watch,
the cricket game that was happening while again basking in the sunlight. Saw a total of 6 catches being missed.

After that went to my room and did Duolingo straight for around 45 minutes. Then some youtube I guess. No, then I got a message from a girl
who I befriended on a dating app. She usually messages once every month or so, when she wants to rant or something I guess. She's like a penpal, so after talking to her for a while, went to mess for dinner.
Ate Paneer Malwani and Paneer Kolhapuri and roamed around a bit.
Afterwards, again sat down for Duolingo and did that with the goal to complete a section. But unfortunately sleep beckoned me again, seriously how much did
I slept yesterday.

Yeah, so that was yesterday. Adios blog 👋
