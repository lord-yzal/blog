Woke up around 6:00 am in the morning. After that went to fetch milk and get ready for the gym.
Also, woke up a classmate since he wanted to start gym too and took him with me.

At gym, I hit legs today which I did squats with my max being a 20 kg plate on both sides.
After gym, I installed some Punjabi learning apps to learn punjabi and then did my daily Duolingo spanish lesson.

Today I learned:

- Juan/El come manzanas => Juan/He eats apples.
- Tu eres Jose => You are Jose.
- El es un nino => He is a boy.
- Yo soy una mujer => I am a woman (una used with feminine)

In punjabi, I just read some words.

After that I started problem solving on leetcode and did the 3 questions from neetcode.
I also slept in the afternoon, which did ruin my schedule again so I've decided to just study in library only.

In library, I did 3 questions more on leetcode and also helped my friend in debugging is react code in which he was
stuck due to Switch being depreceated in react-router-dom v6.

I also helped another friend in making the backend for note-taking app. I will ask for the github link for him, to keep the repo as reference.
It might come in handy in the future.

In the evening, me and my friends went to eat outside, treat of my friend having gotten rich after scholarship.
There we were duped with Roti in the name of Kulche ü´†. Apart from that, food was good.

After coming home, I somehow drank 2 scoops protein with water. I don't know what made me buy raw unflavored whey üò≠, the taste is horrendus.
Had to pinch my nose close with one hand and just swallowed everything in one go.

Then looked at puzzles.

One was the ant and triangle puzzle: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-21-3-ants-and-triangle/

There will be 2 cases where no collision will take place, and total possibilities are 2^3 = 8.
The probability of collision is 6/8.

Another was the hell and heaven puzzle: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-heaven-hell/

There are two gates, one to hell and the other to heaven. Two gatekeepers, one for each gate. One of them always speaks the truth and the other always lies but you don‚Äôt know which one guards which gate. You are allowed only one question and you need to find out the gate to heaven. What is the question?

Solution: Ask any guard ‚ÄúWhat would the other guard say if I ask which way is to the hell ?‚Äù And whatever answer he give is the way to the heaven. Explanation: If you end up asking the question to the truthful one, he will speak the truth and he knows that other guard is going to lie so he will show the way to the heaven. If you end up asking the question to the liar, he will lie about the other and the answer will be the way to the heaven.
