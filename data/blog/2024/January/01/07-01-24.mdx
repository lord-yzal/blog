Woke up around 7:30am and after getting milk and brushing my teeth, sat down to give contest on leetcode. No gym, as it is Sunday.
I was once again only able to solve 1 out of the total 4 problems on leetcode. Really need to practice a lot moreeeee.

I was stuck on Queen Rook Bishop problem for half an hour, and was even looking the cases all wrong. Facepalm, there were only 2 possibilities
of queen being attacked and somehow I was calculating for 3 steps in which the rook will defeat queen if bishop is in the way. üò≠

After that completed the nextjs tutorial and ate eggs. After that spent some time on Duolingo which just gave exercises on previous words.
Once again slept in the afternoon. I don't know why all of a sudden I am getting sleepy in the afternoon. I think it's just my brain avoiding studying
in the afternoon.

So, after waking up went for a bath and took with me the pile of dirty socks and hankerchiefs that I gathered for so long. Took me an hour to wash my clothes
and bath myself. Afterwards, went to drink fruit juice with my friends and I ordered a apple milkshake. Was so-so.

Came to my room at 4pm and wasted time for whole 1 hour on youtube shorts and videos. üôÇ
What's the use of deleting instagram, twitter and not reading webnovels if I am just using that time to scroll on youtube.

Need to be consciously aware of how I am utilising my time.

After that for 2 hours saw some tutorials on react native for creating an e-commerce app after building the website on nextjs.
Had my dinner at 7 in which I ate Shahi Paneer, that was really good. After a walk around the college campus, came back to my room.

Watched a tutorial on how to do navigation on react native. Also drank milk and now I am writing this.
Somehow, 1 week of the new year has already passed by and I have completed some targets of this week while some are still left pending.

Really need to up my game or just remain mediocre.
