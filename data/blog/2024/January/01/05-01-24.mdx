Woke up around 7am and did not go to gym to give some rest to my back.
Today I tested the egg boiler that I bought online and it was a relief that it worked as intended. So much, that I went and got
myself a tray of eggs üò∏ in the evening.

So, early in the morning I started working on the eCommerce tutorial and worked on it for 2 hours. Afterwards, my friend came
running to my room asking for help regarding interview questions that may be asked based on web development.

I don't why he came to me apart from the reason that we are friends. I also know that I have a image of someone who is good in development
in my class, but all I am good at is following tutorials and learning from them. I mean if you have completed one MERN stack tutorial, you can
almost code anything similar. All of my friends have just not delved into the field much, and so just consider me good, which is very wrong.

I can just hope to work on myself to not prove their expectations of me wrong.

Afterwards, I went for a bath and me and friends made our way to the mess at 12pm. But just before entering the mess, me and 1 roomie decided to
ditch the mess food and went for juice and lassi instead. My stomach was already filled after eating a lot of almonds and raw peanuts.

So, I just drank one papaya juice and brought one sweet lassi back to my room. After drinking the lassi, I went to sleep for around 2 hours, not sure.
After that followed the tutorial for 2 hours and made plans to go out with my friends for his birthday treat.

After having a dissapoint dinner at a restaurant, which my lazy ass recommended due to its closeness to our hostel, I came back to my room having bought
a tray of eggs. In my room, listened my friend rant about his shitty life, because he performed poorly on the interview.

After that I again followed the tutorial for around 2 hours, after which I am writing this blog.

I was thinking, I will just make one e-commerce app and publish it on the playstore for experience. Apart from that, I am already following one
course for full stack development. I will keep following it, as it only takes place on the weekends.

I will put all of my energy into learning devOps as I feel there is more scope in that field and also because I don't like the frontend part of development.
So, after completing this ecommerce app, I will start devOps and get myself a decent job around it.
