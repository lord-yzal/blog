Spent my morning hitting chest at the gym. Did 10 reps from 22.5kg. Will go for 15 reps next time and if successful can graduate to
25kgs. Also need to take care of my left forearm. It has started hurting.
After gym, studied for 1hr, slept for 2.

After eating cheesy corn roll and lassi, went to a friend to see his coding assessment.
There, got to see how far behind I am from some of my peers. After that coded for around 2 hours I guess.

Then went to eat poha and afterwards wasted around 1 hour on youtube shorts. Then another on watching fitness content.

After dinner, coded for 2 hours I guess. That even a simple problem, that should not have taken that much time.
Yeah, I am shit at coding. And yeah, even knowing that I am somehow not giving proper time and effort.

Afterwards, tried solving today's daily problem. It was medium one but could not think up the logic and had to
ask my roomie, who helped me.
Now writing this here, with the will to have a better tomorrow.

I have decided on Friday and Saturday, I will strive to become up to date with cohort course,
as I am very far behind.

Just saw that the cohort is on week 5 and have just reached till Todo app in React. So, I will be able to catch up if I gave it my all.
