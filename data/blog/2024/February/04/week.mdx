## Goals

1. Prepare for interviews
2. Get placed somewhere

### Start of Week:

Enough is enough is what I would like to say, but I have already done this charade so many times, I don't know at this point.
Well, I think "this" time will be the last.

If I deviate this time, I will just delete my instagram account. Funny, how I find deleting my instagram account more bearable than
deleting my royalroad account.

Yeah, so now let's add some consequences to my actions, to keep myself in line, because self-improvement apparently is not large enough
motivation.
