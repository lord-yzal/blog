Writing this on 21st Feb.

Yesterday, had a nice push day at gym. Still stuck at 8 reps for 25kg dumbbells. Need more strengthhhhhh.

Afterwards, sat down to work and studied about dbms stuff. Left the internship that I joined.
Ate chicken roll at night, due to the sudden urge to eat something different.

Somehow,this urge has started appearing more and more. I am also eating more junk food in hindsight.
Need to keep this in mind and get some healthy snacks to munch on when I am in my room.

Apart from that, everything is chill only.

Adios blog, Hasta manana.
