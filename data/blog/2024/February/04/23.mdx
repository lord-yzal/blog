Woke up super horny. Now that I have some job security with a intern, my mind has started focussing over other matters, mainly getting a girlfriend and enjoying rest of the 4th year. Installed hinge and bumble. On opening them found that I had already deleted my profile. I did not have it in me to create new profiles and only after confirming
that there is no dating to be had, did my "rational" side took over and started scolding myself, about being weak-willed and what not. I mean he is right, my main priority is turning my life around, but does not have to be asshole about it.

I think my life will reach its end trying to juggle my 2 sides of the brain. One, which wants to work hard and achieve something but does not put that much effort and the other side which just wants to enjoy life being average and going with the flow.

With the horny devil out of my body, I got up and went to the gym. There had a routine push day. There are some juniors who have been going to gym from 12th class or earlier,
seeing how buffed they are. They make me look smol. I already know me will get big with time but just ranting here.

After gym, looked myself in the mirror and became narcisstic. Comparing to my past self, there definitely is some progress and I am loving my long hair.
Then just lied down for a bit but ultimately ended up sleeping. Woke up around 11:30pm then read a webnovel.

At this point, my mind is over webnovels too, but some authors are so great at writing that I keep coming back to see, what all stuff happened from where I left it.

Then, talked to my brother and then mom. Got a huge reality check that, Life's not all roses and rainbows. Well, then I started working on an app that I had an idea for.
