Woke up and went to gym, hit legs today. There is some improvement and legs are looking a bit bigger.
After that, did duolingo for 10 minutes. Really need to revise spanish one of these days. Have been slacking on that front.

Then after bathing, and breakfast sat down to work. Started working on the internship and spend the entire day
doing that only. I will probably leave. I can't sit around for 8 hours and work like that.

At evening gave interview for another intern. Have another interview later on.
Then after dinner, roamed the college campus with friends and after reading webnovels for half an hour
will go to sleep now.

Adios, blog 👋
