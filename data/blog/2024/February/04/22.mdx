Went to the gym but came after a quick warmup. Didn't feel that much strength.
Then, my 2nd roomie went home leaving me alone in our triplet.

Today, I also got the confirmation of intern and so just spent the entire day indulging myself.

Watched youtube, porn, read webnovels, ate a lot of junk food. Eat dinner and lunch in food court instead of going to the mess.

After indulging myself, it did not feel I was celebrating or enjoying myself. It was more of a running from responsibilities and tasks that I had assigned myself to do today.
I am weak bitch, ig, taking the first oppurtinity to not do the tasks I have set up for myself.

It is the sole reason that I am not good at problem solving from the past 2 years, even after knowing its importance since long back.

Apart from that, I think I am tired of being a consumer. Watching youtube, reading novels written by others. It just feels inferior. I feel like I should also do something.
Yeah, need to start something. Welp, guess will go to sleep after wasting this day.

Adios blog 👋
