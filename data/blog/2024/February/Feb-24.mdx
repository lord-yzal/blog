## Goals

1. College project complete
2. Striver Sheet
3. Neetcode 150
4. 30 puzzles
5. 30 days of Javascript
6. 50 SQL questions
7. 30kg dumbbell incline bench press
8. Meditation start
9. Comfortable reading punjabi

The list looks quite long, but it is fairly achievable as each by from 4 to 6 will hardly take an hour of my time and I can even spread them
over the day. Now that goals have been set, let's see how I fare this month.

## Change alert - 20 Feb 24

Yeah, so as the saying goes "Man proposes, Heaven disposes". I had all this stuff to do, but I got unplaced and well plans changed.
And I just saw that only 8 days are left for this month. And things that I will do before the month ends:

1. College project
2. Neetcode 150
3. Angular Nest Ionic blog
