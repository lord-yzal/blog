## Goals

The list looks quite long, but it is fairly achievable as each by from 4 to 6 will hardly take an hour of my time and I can even spread them
over the day. Now that goals have been set, let's see how I fare this month.

## Change alert - 20 Feb 24

Yeah, so as the saying goes "Man proposes, Heaven disposes". I had all this stuff to do, but I got unplaced and well plans changed.
And I just saw that only 8 days are left for this month. And things that I will do before the month ends:

1. College project
2. Neetcode 150
3. Angular Nest Ionic blog

## End of month:

1st week

1. cake ðŸ˜­
2. door event diff branch

2nd week

1. paneer hyderabadi ðŸ˜‚
2. angular intern assignment

3rd week

1. Got unplaced. Spent the week either applying or just wasting time under the guise of how such a thing happened to me.

4th week

1. Got intern at a fairly good organization. Will aim for PPO there, culture is good, but the pay is low.

5th week

1. complete take home assignment of an early stage startup. Let's see what happens.
2. created habit planner but will implement it from March now ðŸ™‚
3. made profile on dating apps and wasted a lot of time there.

So overall, I would say, that I wasted a lot of time this month. Apart from that, I do feel a bit stronger and more confident in my body.
Going to the gym has brought some good changes, and I don't feel skinny now. I like that.

Apart from that, need to work on my willpower a bit more. I very easily give in to temptations.
So, that will be the focus for the month of March.
