### Today Goals: OAuth extension github: ❌

Woke up and went to gymmmmm. Today had a legs session and it was alright.
Afterwards, came back did Duolingo for around 10 minutes, then made my bed and drank protein.

Sat down to study and did for 1.5 hours. Then ate 4 boiled eggs after which friends called for lunch.
During lunch, remembered that I forgot to call my gym buddy and joked around on it.

After lunch, slept for around 1.5 hours. Worked for around 2 hours, then went for a haircut, due to dandruff making my life miserable.
Had a bad haircut, (what was I expecting...)

In my room, did some lower back and abs exercises for 10 minutes and then went for a bath.
The lighting in the bathroom is pretty good. I spent 10-15 minutes in front of the mirror itself 😂.

After a bath, went for dinner and roaming around college for a bit came back to my room.
Worked for 1.5 hours. Felt bored, again went out to roam.

Both of my roomies are not here, and my brother was also busy. Me feeling bored, lonely, and wanting to hang out installed bumble.
Then spent the next hour, finding my good images and classified old images into various albums.

While doing that thought, just what I am doing. Uninstalled bumble, went to brush my teeeth and now writing this.
Now will go to sleep.

Hasta luego blog 👋
