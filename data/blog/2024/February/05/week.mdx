## Start of week

Now adding monetary factor to keep myself in check. Even though I have wasted a lot of time, which I should not have done, One thing that I am not cheating on is
writing falsehoods in my blog. With this in mind, I will impose a fine on me for not able to complete a habit I am trying to build or on doing a habit, that I'm trying to break.

At the end of the day, I will send these fine amount to my brother. This way, I am sure I will follow the script that I have written for myself, because somehow it's ok for me to cheat
on the goals I've set for myself, but it's not ok for my brother or any other 3rd party to see, how much of a slacker I am.

I guess this is just human nature, not wanting to appear foolish or dumb in front of another and I have decided to use this to keep myself in check.
Let's see what changes occur then.
