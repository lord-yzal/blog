Yoo, today I woke up at 4am in the morning. Looked blockchain stuff for college project for around 1 hour.
Afterwards, again went to sleep. Then woke up and went to the gym at 7:20 AM.

Today, I had a back and biceps session. It was fun, and in the end biceps looked big, so noiceee.
After gym, ate 4 eggs and then sat down to work. Worked for around 2 hours and then time for lunch.

Ate chole bhature today with chaach, and then slept for 3 hours ðŸ™‚ from 1pm to 4pm.
After that went out for a fruit shake and drank chikoo shake. Back in my room, downloaded IvyWallet app
to calculate all my expenses.

When going to the fruit shop, I was thinking that I'll download this app to keep track of all my expenses.
I wanted to buy a chips packet, but thinking that I will have to enter buying junk food on the app stopped me ðŸ˜‚.

So, that's good I guess. Not that I am forgoing junk food altogether, but still avoiding them overall is good for me naaa.
Another thing I need to stop is playing with my beard, and plucking hairs while watching a youtube video or thinking in general.
I don't want a bald patch to appear, but it's deeply ingrained habit now. Same with eating nails. Same with using cuss words. ðŸ˜­

Then I researched and watched tutorials for around 1 hour regarding college project and watching youtube in between.
I need to have some dedicated slot in my day, where I work with complete focus without taking breaks every 45minutes or 1 hour.
Will try it out after eating dinner today only since I slept a lot in the afternoon.

Did nothing, just scrolled instagram for 3-4 hours after dinner.

Could've watched a movie but no, that wastes time.
Let's doomscroll insta for 4 hours. Sure why not **facepalms**

Sigh, yeah so this shit happened. It's like history repeats itself. 3-4 days of work, then 1 day I will do something that will sabotage my day.

Welp, move on now ig.
