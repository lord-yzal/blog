Yoiiii, went to gym at 7:20am and hit chest and triceps today. For a long time, I have been stuck at 25kg dumbbells only
on the inclined chest dumbbell press, need to move up but how?

After gym, came to my room and did duolingo for about half an hour then slept...
Woke up around 11am, had a bath, ate 4 eggs and sat down to study. Studied for about 1 hour, then moved to the library.
In the library I studied for around 4.5 hours, could've done better.

Today was friday, so paid food day. Ordered Paneer Malwani and Butter paneer and ate till I filled myself up. Then when roaming
around the college, saw my friends from another branch playing basketball and joined them. Had simple fun friendly games, where
no one was overtly competitive, just playing to have fun. Then 1 player left and I did a small 1v2 match, which I lost ðŸ¥² being the only
person in my team and playing on a full stomach wearing jeans ðŸ™ƒ. After the game I was full sweaty.

Today, I also scrolled insta for around 1 hour some in evening and some after playing basketball in my room. Uninstalled it at
night since it just gives a reason to scroll my phone and nothing else.

Drank protein and milk too.
Did duolingo again for some 10minutes, then just scrolled my gallery because I had nothing better to do.
Slept at around 11:30pm
