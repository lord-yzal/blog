After this went to bath, and was shaving my underarms which then led me to removing hair from all over my upper body.
Well, stuff happened and I took around 2 hours to bath also having to clean my shoes also.

Then studied for 1 hour and then went to sleep. Slept from 3 to 5pm, then again studied for 1.5 hours.
Ate dinner and again studied for 1 hour. Then made a plan with my friend to go to rome and eat everything 😤.
So, I guess we will go in 2029. Who knows what all stuff will happen and what all things I'd be doing. Let's see.
Hoping for a noice future.

Then drank milk with whey protein 🤢. I don't know why I decided to save 300rs and bought raw whey without any flavor.
Ate raisins to wash off the taste and now me going to sleep. Adios, blog 👋
