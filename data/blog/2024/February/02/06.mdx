Yo, I woke up around 3:30am. Studied from 4am to 7am. Then went to the gym from 8am to 9am and hit chest and triceps.
One thing I won't do again are tricep dips. That exercise is totally uncomfortable and really not for me.

Then I studied for around 2 hours, then went for lunch around 2pm. Then went to library and studied for 2 hours again.
So, ultimately I did study for 7 hours. That was great. I just need to keep this going.

In evening, called my brother and tried speaking spanish but failed miserably 😂. Learnt about angular testing today.

Afterwards, talked with a friend for some time and then went straight to sleep around 11:30pm.
That was my entire day. Adios blog.
