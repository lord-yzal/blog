Yo, I woke up around 7am. Went to the gym but it was crowded as hell, so then played basketball for around 45 minutes
with my friends. Then went to gym till 9am and hit legs. Destroyed legs doing lunges but forgot to do calf raises.

Afterwards worked for 2 hours on finding online code for my college project. Also drank protein and ate eggs.
Went for a bath, and then moved for lunch. After lunch slept from 1pm to 3pm.

Went to academic block for college project, but that got cancelled.
Then went to the library from 4 to 7pm and studied again for 2 hours.

After that ate dinner, played basketball again with friends. Came back to my room and went to sleep straight.
