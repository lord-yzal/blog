Went to the gym in the morning but came back after 15 mintues, was not feeling it.
Then did duolingo for half an hour.
Sat to study angular, watching tutorials while eating chips. Studied for 2 hours and revised all angular concepts.

In afternoon, started reading webnovels and read till 10pm
Studied from 10pm till 12pm, then went to sleep.

Reading that webnovel, made me think of my reason to live or any goals. Nothing comes to mind that stems from deep within,
that this is my calling or this is what I want to do. So I guess for now I'll just try to work on me only
