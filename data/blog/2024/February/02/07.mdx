Yo, I woke up around 5:30am. Worked from 6am to 7:30 ish am.
For gym, today we(3) decided to take a rest, because everyone was feeling sore from the workout yesterday.
But no, me and my one friend soldiered on and went to hit back and biceps today. So, I took my creatine and lemon flavored glucon-d
and then went to the gym 😤

Ultimately, it ended up being a nice gym session. I was even able to bicep curl 12.5kg dumbbells for 1 set with 10 reps.
I have also started hitting my abs everyday, just 1-2 exercises at the end. That's because next month is Holi, and you have
to remove your t-shirt or it gets ripped. So, me thinking of going with some abs definition 🫡

Currently it's 10:56am. I'll sleep for 1 hour, then go for lunch and after that start studying
