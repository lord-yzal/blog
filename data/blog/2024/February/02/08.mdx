Yo, I woke up around 7:00 AM. Then worked for around 1 hour deploying a project. Afterwards, went to play badminton and played mixed doubles.
Afterwards, went to the gym and hit my abs for 10 minutes.

Came to my room and just had a cheat day I guess. Read webnovels and slept around.

In the evening, the food on mess menu was just meh, so friends decided to go out to eat.
Booked a cab and all 4 of us went there. 2 of us were non-veg and 2 were veg.

I ate murg musallam and fish something as the starter. The veg party got a really good paneer starter but
the paneer hyderabad they ordered was really really bad. Their whole mood got ruined.
Ours was good though.

Then walked to a bus stop and after reaching college, ate an ice cream and watched some people playing + verbally sparring
while playing basketball.

Then just came to my room, did some Duolingo, listened to some music and then went to sleep.
