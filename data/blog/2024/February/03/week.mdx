## Goals

1. College project complete hopefully

### Start of Week:

This time not to overestimate. My main priority is completing final year project, because I will be graded on this.
From this week also started tracking my mobile screen time, and number of unlocks. From tomorrow I will only use my laptop
for work purposes only.

### End of week:

Got unplaced. Spent the week either applying or just wasting time under the guise of how such a thing happened to me.
