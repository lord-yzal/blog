Today had an interview, so woke up around 7am to study for it.
Worked on my projects for around 1 hour, then went to the library.

There studied for approximately 2.5 hours. There my interview got postponed to 4pm.
So after dinner, I again went to the library and prepared for around 2 hours for the interview.

The interview went good only. Let's see what happens. So, interview time was 4pm to 5pm.
Afterwards, went to the gym and hit leg day with my friend. Session went good only I'd say, but forgot to hit
calves.

Then was thinking of getting my beard groomed and buy a tray of eggs, so went out with my friends.
Went to pizza hut, ate a nice idli (forgot the franchisee name), then bought caramel popcorns for rs 50.
They were only so-so, then I understood why they were so cheap. After taking popcorns, we just wanted
to go to our beds, so bought a tray of eggs and went back to home.

For dinner, ate 6 boiled eggs and then chatted away with friends and watched youtube.
Now, writing blog at 11:51pm and then going to sleep.

Hasta manana blog, 👋
