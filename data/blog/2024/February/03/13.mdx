Woke up at 7am and studied for 1 hour from 7am to 8am.
Then went to the gym for 1 hour and had a great chest session.

Then studied for 2 hours trying to run code of my college project.
After lunch went to the library and worked there for 1.5 hours I guess.

Had a bet with groupmate that who'll able to get the code running first.
I won, heh. Then came back to my room and looked at the codebase for 1 hour I guess.

Then went to sleep for 2 hours, woke up and went to get my beard groomed.
Mission failed and had to get a clean shave done.

Then came back ate chicken roll, junk food, cheat day and then went to sleep.
