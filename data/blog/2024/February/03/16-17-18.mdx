Eh, cheat days only I'd say.
Applying a lot, making lot of resume variations and let's see I guess.
Will hopefully have a interview in the next week for a full time role.
I have been able to get some intern roles but there's no surity of it becoming a full time role, as they are startups only.

Apart from that, lower back has somehow started hurting. I think it's my sleeping posture and just not focussing on it enough
in the gym.

So, from now on will start focussing on it more. After dinner just scrolled instagram for no reason.
I have got enough motivation now, so down goes insta in the bin.

Let's get the grind started then.
Adios blog. Plan is to wake up tomorrow early and start work.
