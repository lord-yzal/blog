### Today Goals

Woke up at 7am. Went to the gym and hit back and biceps today. Felt nice.
Came back, opened linkedin and started applying online.

Worked for around 5-6 hours I'd say.
Gave 2 AI interviews. Let's see what becomes of that.
Slept from 7pm to 8:20pm, then went outside to drink juice and get some energy in.
Gave one coding assessment at night and then went to sleep.

Adios, blog.

PS: Need to increase my water intake. It's a measly 1.5L only ðŸ™‚
