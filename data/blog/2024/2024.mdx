# Be consistent whatever happens and track everything! Nothing else matters

This is my year to just be consistent. On introspection, I have seen that the only problem in my life is my lack of consistency.
If I take care of that, my life will sort itself out and all my problems will wink out of existence.

For the year 2024, I have defined achievable goals without overestimating myself.

This year, physically, I want to become fit and a bit big in size. I also want to be able to touch my feet,
and unfuck my lower back which I have harmed by doing deadlifts.
Mentally, I want a dopamine reset, so I will make a habit of meditation and read something from Guru Granth Sahib everyday.

For career, I will ensure to do the items listed, to get in a good company.
For upskilling, blockchain is for basically my college project. I wanted to get a job in web3, but the field seems esoteric to me.

Hussein Nasser courses I will do to get a better understanding of software engineering. Trading is a very important tool to learn
if you want your money to do the work for you, so I will focus a bit on this too.

I also want to start social media, as it is the best way to become popular and earn money. For that, I want to get a bit good
in the other aspects that I mentioned because they will enable me to be more comfortable posting stuff online.

In life, I basically want to learn spanish, this year just because to prove consistency and learn a new language.
In hobby, I want to ensure that I am writing my journey.
