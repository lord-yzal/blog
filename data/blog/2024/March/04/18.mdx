# Wow, another low

## The entry below were my thoughts from 10th of March and on 17th of March I still had the same thoughts ðŸ™‚, albeit with some differences.

Yup, so another week has ended. This week I basically did some intern work and wasted a lot of time on ~~dating apps~~ insta.
~~Bumble worked like a charm, the first time, so I was hoping for another but I have realised it's just wishful thinking.~~
I also talked a bit with a girl, but she lives in another city, so ultimately a nice acquaintance only.

One reel on instagram made me realise this, everything will happen in time. And I should not rush after things in fear of FOMO or comparing myself with other people around me.

### I understand everything, but I don't know why I am so shit at acting on them.

I don't know why I have to remind myself so many times, that the only comparison I have is with myself and I only have to do better
than the me of yesterday. I am subconsciously ignoring this, so that I can take it easy. But from now on I will keep reminding myself,
because I do want to be more.

I can either work hard now or I'll have to do this hard work years later.

Yeah, so now is the day from today. I have had enough of shitty posts where I whine about how I am just a barking dog basically, all bark and now bite. Yes, so now only goal will be to try and complete the daily goals set and defeat the me of yesterday.

Went to the gym and did around 20 normal squats and 50 with weigts on my upper back.
After that completed work for my final year project and some intern research work.

I did use insta today, will minimise it's use from tomorrow.
I also read webnovels, will not read it from tomorrow.

So, ultimately I did work for around 6 hours I guess? Good start but can be a lot better.
Will defeat this bitch's score tomorrow ðŸ˜¤
