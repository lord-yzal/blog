20th March
No Gym
Studied for my exam for around 3 hours,
gave the exam 1 hour,
coding for 1 hour,

Ate maggi, paneer masala roll and lassi too.
Indulged myself to the full...


21st March
No gym, worked for around 5 hours ig.
Played a new interest online board game with the team,
where you have to buy cities and people going over your
city have to pay rent.

Lost really badly.
Worked for an hour again and then went to sleep.
