Yoiii, woke up around 7:30am and had a nice back and bicpes session from 8am to 9am.
Biceps were really pumped up after that. Recorded my progress and sat down to do some intern work.

So, I have no specific work timings as long as I get the work done and attend the meetings, so that has made my
routine all over the place. I basically lazed around and did work in a loop throught the day.

If I had to put a number, I'd say around 6 hours of work on intern.
2 hours - meet
1+2+1 - coding

So, that basically covered my entire day. Had to study for midsem exam tomorrow, but did not, only downloaded the
pdf and looked at the index. Will study for it tomorrow only.

Apart from that had a nice day, but I will keep a proper track of how much I work because it was all over the day today.
Completed my protein goals today also.

Oki, sayonara blog.
