Yup, so another week has ended. This week I basically did some intern work and wasted a lot of time on dating apps.
Bumble worked like a charm, the first time, so I was hoping for another but I have realised it's just wishful thinking.

After swiping so many times when I started swiping on anyone, it hit me like a truck, that what am I doing.
Sure, I want someone to hangout with and go on cute dates, but that doesn't mean I would go out with anyone.

That'll turn just like my last dates, where I go out with them for 1 or 2 dates, then make up some shitty excuse.
So, I uninstalled all the dating apps. I will install them again only when I have replaced all the images that I upload on the profile.
That's the goal I have set for myself. One with a good physique, one with a cool bike ig.

One reel on instagram made me realise this, everything will happen in time. And I should not rush after things in fear of FOMO or comparing
myself with other people around me.

I don't know why I have to remind myself so many times, that the only comparison I have is with myself and I only have to do better
than the me of yesterday. I am subconsciously ignoring this, so that I can take it easy. But from now on I will keep reminding myself,
because I do want to be more.

I can either work hard now or I'll have to do this hard work years later.

Yeah, so let's see how I go through my life after making big promises to myself today.
