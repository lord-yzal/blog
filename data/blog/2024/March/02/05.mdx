# 04 and 05 March 2024

## 04 March

On 4th of march I started my day with 2 intern offers in hand with uncertainty of which one to chose.
In one, I started work already whereas in other I was free apart from some meetings as I did not receive the laptop.

Entire day I worked on 1 intern and going through the codebase.
In the evening I took opinions of my seniors to get a objective view of things. Ultimately, I decided to go with the more established one with less pay
instead of a very small company with more pay.

Ultimately, the tie breaker was the fact I wanted to work in a large team and see how the work is done.

I was also assigned a module based on PoSH, Prevention of Sexual Harassment, which I completed and came upon important information.

## 05 March

Woke up went to the gym. Yesterday had a pure chest day. So yesterday, my body was not in pain but waking up today I had soreness in my chest.
Even while going down the stairs, the little up and down motion of chest really stung ðŸ˜­ and I couldn't make use of my arms due to them.

Ultimately, had a leg session today, but even that went subpar only as leg press, my most important exercise machine was not in a working state.

After the leg session, started my intern. Had a call with some older members. Received and set up my laptop in the afternoon.
After intern work, went out with my roomie to buy a tray of eggs and there we ate Murgh Tikka. That was delish albeit a bit costly.

After that drank hot masala milk which had badam, kesar, elaichi and stuff at a stall and then came back to my room.
Did some time pass and now going to go for sleep.

Adios, I'll be trying te be regular from tomorrow in blog writing.
