Yo, so today was the first day of Feb.

Skipped gym to give my body the rest it required. 
Had a quick bath, ate 250gms black grapes (I forgot their actual name) and first of all finished writing about the month of Jan.

Afterwards, discussed about a project that came our way. It was some sort of e-commerce app that the client wanted to build.
Unfortunately, we had no problem building the app, but the problem was of hosting and scaling the architecture as per need.

The client said heavy traffic for 2-3 months and also wanted us to manage the app and website for around 1 month. Due to our lack of knowledge,
we had to leave it. Basically it was way out of our league. For now.

That took my 3-4 hours trying to see hosting methods and determining costs but ultimately we backed off.
After that slept from 2 to 4pm after lunch. Then studied for around 1 hour, and went to eat poha for evening snack.

In the evening, went out to buy a tray of eggs and ultimately walked a lot so that I could count it in my physical activity goals.
Afterwards came to my room, made a very bad tasting milk shake, swallowed it somehow and then watched some youtube videos.

Basically, after lunch I slept which I should not have and procrastrinated the entire day. Yup, pretty much that only.
Me again neglecting problem solving skills in the name of completing college project.

I have given myself this week till Sunday, to complete our college project, Afterwards I will force myself to become a problem solving maniac.
Ultimately, that's the only thing stopping me from become layoff proof.

Adios blog. Let's make something out of this life ig.
