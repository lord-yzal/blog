Writing this on 30th of Jan. Need to fix this habit of writing here the next day.

First of all, if I was going to write this yesterday, this would have been a sad post of me not good enough.
Basically not living upto the goals that I think I can be. All this because participating in events whether it be
sports or anything, you compare yourself to other people and well, comparison is the bane of joy.

So, yesterday we lost match against one team and won against another. So, we came 3rd overall. Better than being last.
Now, I am thinking what even to rant about. I already know the answers to my problem, just be consistent, comparison should
be with your past self and give your best and just enjoy life in general. OK, I think some comparison with others is good.
Makes you competitive and makes you want to work more.

Yeah, so about my day. Woke up at 8am, did not go to the gym since had 2 matches in the evening. Ate eggs and went to
the library from 9am to 12pm. There made some changes to the app and tested it in general. I think I've done enough.
I want to focus on my problem solving skills, that I am really neglecting. So, on 30 and 31, I will wrap all development stuff,
and from Feb onwards, start focussing on leetcode exclusively.

Ate lunch, and went to sleep for 2 hours. Went to library again from 3pm to 4pm. Then around 5pm went for my matches.
Lost the first game and won the another. The first one we lost by a large margin and the second one we won by a large margin.

After that, I bought 2 milk packets, since my dinner got skipped. Made oreo shake with one and bourbon shake with another.

Afterwards, talked to my friends who told me how they visited a very rich college where everyone had a BMW or Porsche and 
stories of how they are enjoying life in general. Yeah, so that was another reason why I was feeling a lil shitty.

Nevermind though, since I am writing this on 30th Jan, had a great gym session with 3 gym bros now. So, that was great and fun.
I tried picking 25kg dumbells for shoulder press but couldn't üòñ and dropped it with a thud on the floor when I couldn't lift it
over my shoulder.

Yeah, so that was all. See you at night only, since I will write for 30th Jan today itself.
Adios blog, üëã
