Yoii, so today I woke up around 7:00 am and went to gym at 8:00 am.
There I had a nice back and shoulder session. Also, the day before after dinner I went to the gym
to weigh myself and it came around 75kgs. So, in the morning I weighed myself again with an empty stomach,
it was around 70kgs. 

In my mind, I was like my weight would be around 72 kgs, and so 70kg was unexpected. Need to eat moreeeeeeee.

After gym, drank protein and sat down to work.
Today for 2 hours I just browsed job openings and applied to them. It was a unneccessary action, because I wanted to 
add the eCommerce store to my resume before applying, but I just felt like exploring the job market.

After that went for lunch, and created my email template for sending job openings. After that, I lied down on my bed
and started scrolling YT shorts. One thing led to another, and I am disappointed to say that I broke my no fap streak today.

That was pretty disappointing, because the entire point of no fapping for me was to have control over my mind. Hopefully, this
does not happen again this year. After that, I just went to sleep and woke up around 6:30pm.

Coded for half an hour and completed all the screens for the android except checkout, which I will do after payment integration.
After dinner, send porno links to my friend who got curious, and was spammed with big ass porno links.

I also disabled youtube on my phone. I am not stopping myself from watching youtube, but I want that if I am watching something,
it should be on my laptop only as after some time I automatically get back to work. I also set a timer on linkedin because my good
for nothing brain, always looks for another distraction to waste away my time. 

Only interesting thing left on my phone now is Duolingo, and I don't mind if I spend more time on it as learning spanish is already my goal.

From that I remembered that I learned new words today
abuela: grandmother
abuelo: grandfather
esposa: wife,
esposo: husband,
padre: father,
madre: mother,
hermano: brother,
hermana: sister,
hijo: son,
hija: daughter,
muy: very,
bonito: pretty,
gato: cat,
perro: dog,
mesa: table,
para: for,
quiero: I want,

These are what I remember now, some words I have repeated again.

Then I coded for 2 hours and completed the frontend for the admin dashboard too.
The goal for tomorrow is to integrate the frontend with the backend. Let's see how much time that process takes.

Sayonara, blog/diary. Hopefully, me will get some nice dreams today :p
