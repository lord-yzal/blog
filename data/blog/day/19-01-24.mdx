Yo, woke up around 7:20, Went to gym at 7:30am.
Today was supposed to be leg day, but I just hit my chest, triceps and biceps and called it a day.
My back is really not feeling up to par, so didn't feel like hitting squats.

Had a nice session and even lifted 25kg dumbbells on incline chest press.
After gym, went to the washroom and took some pics in front of the mirror to mark my progress.

To be honest, I prolly look the same but with just more strength and slightly bigger arms I think.

After that, I just drank protein and folded all the clothes that had been lying on my bed
for so long. I just cleaned my room today.

Then while eating 4 eggs, watched a video on the israeli-palestine conflict. Nasty war going on.
Jews have been persecuted for so long that now they have settled in Israel, they don't want another
country palestine there in the name of security.

Palestine have been wronged, having been thrown out of their house with lines drawn by the british.
God knows, what will happen next.

So, after that went for lunch to eat curry ü´† in mess. Afterwards, drank lassi and just scrolled youtube some more.
Then, did some coding in my room for around 45 minutes and also talked with school friend. After that just decided to go to library
and worked on the app for around 2 hours. I was in the library from 3:37 to 6:37pm out.

Then again, went out near college only to eat out as roomie was going to give party to the friend (overachiever), who just came back.
Roomie was gracious enough to gimme treat again, so ate a lot of paneer and mushroom. Stomach was filled to the brim.

After that came back to my room and did Duolingo. It showed a lot of new words. Need to practice them too later.
After that had a boner for no reason and had to masturbate. Mind wandering a lot lately...

There always comes a day after continuous 2-3 days of work, that I don't feel like doing anything and same was true for today.
So, I am just writing my blog now and then going to sleep.

Tomorrow, need full focus on completing the apppppppppppppp
