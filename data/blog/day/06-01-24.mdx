Woke up around 7:30am and went to gym. No gym bro today and also leg day, so motivation was not that great.
Went and did some squats and calf raises. I really need to find some ab exercise which is fun to do, otherwise they are just being neglected.
Me want some absssss!

After that ate 4 boiled eggs and drank milk. Yesterday I calculated my protein intake and after taking in account everything, it came around 126g.
I thought not bad, not bad at all! and sent the calculations to my gym bro. He sent me his calculations back and the top was Chicken with protein content of 135g üôÇ. Bruhh, like I am not getting that from my entire diet and dude casually getting more than that from one food item. His total intake was 183gm protein. Cool I guess. I will also start loading myself on chicken and soy chunks when I live outside the hostel üò§

After gym, I came to my room and did one session of Duolingo. It has been teaching some new words like:

Buenos Dias/Noches: Good Morning/Night
Gracias: Thank you
De Nada: You're welcome
Adios: Bye
Tu eres Sam: You're Sam
Yo soy un hombre: I am a man ('un' for male and 'una' is used for females)
disculpe: excuse me

Yeah, so I learnt these words. Apart from that, read a few words from punjabi. I think daily reading some sentences and words will get me fluent
in reading punjabi in no time.

After that I watched the youtube tutorial for 2 hours, after which light went out because apparently the electric pole was being painted. So, me and
my friends just went out to bask in the sunlight and buy bananas.

Afterwards, again studied for some time and after a lousy lunch went to sleep.
After waking up, after another hour of watching tutorial, went with my friends to escort my roomie out and got him to treat us to some
nice street food.
Ate Dabeli, Pani Puri, Aloo tikki, Pav Bhaji, and finally Badam Shake. The badam shake was really goooooood. Will go there sometime again and treat myself to some.

After that came back to my room, watched some youtubers talk about tech and sat down for leetcode biweekly contest. I was only able to solve 1 out of total 4 questions, so really shows how much I need to practice again. Well consistency is key and hopefully will see some results.

By tomorrow, I will complete the youtube tutorial and create excel sheet for all the problems I solve on leetcode.
Apart from that will build my booklist blog on nextjs to really master nextjs and follow good practices. Will keep the design same but will improve the
summary input form. So, that's the goal for tomorrow.

Welp then, will see you tomorrow with some good metrics about my day.
Another notable thing was the BE event that happened. Really need to add it in the weekly entries üòÇ
