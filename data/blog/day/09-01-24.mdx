Yo, today I woke up around 7 and after getting milk and getting ready started gym at 7:30am.
Today was back and biceps, and it was a normal workout. Tried bicep curls with 12.5 kgs, so progress.

Also, I should probably stop thinking of deadlifting. If my goal is just fitness and aesthetics,
logically there are way better exercises that I can perform. I guess I can try deadlifting later when
I get shredded as hell.

After having a nice pump, I came to my room and immediately after some rest went for a bath.
No dilly-dallying this week. After a bath, and eating eggs and drinking milk sat down to solve
today's daily problem around 10am. It was a easy binary tree problem.

Then started building react native app, but got stuck on routing and debugged it.
Did that for 2 hours and then got sleepy and woke up 1 hour later.
Tried to go for lunch, but it was raining so just ate peanut butter and bananas.

After that coded for more than 2 hours I guess because the next time I moved was for tea at 4:30am.
Then ate a samosa in mess and went to canteen for tea, because I wanted real tea, not brown water.

Again worked on the app for 1.5 hours and went for dinner at 7pm
After dinner, did duolingo and learned some new words:

Donde: Where,
Tengo/Agui: have,
Cerrado: closed,
Mi: my,
a: to,
necesito: need,
calle: street,

Yo tengo una reserva: I have a reservation.
Tu eres Jose: You are Jose

Then, sat down to note down all the screens I have to create in the app. There are a lot 🫠.
Idk, how I thought that I will be able to build the app in a day.
Prolly worked for 3 hours more on the app.

Shared my progress with my friend and got the thumbs up 👍, so yayy.
Also shared one funny meme, my roomie created of me 😭

Then talked to my brother for 1 hour talking about life in general and how we brothers need to work more
and be happy, fit and rich. And not bald!

So, that's that. It's 01:09am in night and I guess I'll go to sleep now.

Good Night, blog. Hope you stay active 24/7 ✌️
