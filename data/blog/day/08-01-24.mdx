Yo, today I woke up around 7 and after getting milk and getting ready started gym at 7:30am.
Today was chest and triceps, and again got betrayed by my gym bro, but not me no no no üò§

Though one thing I've noticed there is pain in my left forearm. I think it is due to lifting
heavy weights everyday. There is hardly any exercise where the forearm is not utilized.
So, need to keep my forearms in mind as I was not able to pick the 22.5kg dumbell with my left hand
and could only do 5 reps of incline chest bench press.

After having a nice pump, I came to my room and immediately after some rest went for a bath.
No dilly-dallying this week. After a bath, and eating eggs and drinking milk sat down for solving some
coding problems. I just tried the daily problems again and made an entry of them in excel file.
The last 2 days I had just copy pasted the solution to maintain my streak and didn't even understand the problem.
So, rectified that.

After that, went for lunch but could only eat 2 chapatis due to my stomach being full from 4 eggs.

Then, spent some time scrolling youtube shorts and went to watch tutorial on creating react native applications.

All in all, I spent some 6 hours on the tutorials and just checking the tech out. I think I have enough grasp
of how I want to do stuff, and already started working on the app now by creating the project structure and setting
up project routing. I am fairly confident that I will be able to build a simple workable UI tomorrow and the next 2 days
will be spent on the backend.
There is already a addition of a day now, but I do not want to half-ass things. I will learn how to build a proper backend in nestJS
and will use that only for the app.

Yeah, so this aside in the evening my friend again took us for a treat in our college food court only. Why? because his
leave got approved and he'll be going for 6 months intern. So, that's cool.

I am hoping in this 6 months time I hone my problem solving skills and just be good in tech stuff overall.

So, that's that. It's 12:44am in night and I guess I'll go to sleep now.

Good Night, blog. Hope you stay active 24/7 ‚úåÔ∏è
