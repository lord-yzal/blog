Writing this on 25th Jan.

Yesterday I woke up at 7am and started preparing for my Placement exam which was to be held today.
I searched through google, looked at sample paper and the topics being asked. This took me around 1.5 hours

After that, I had the urge to scroll my phone and I was free till 2pm when the exam was scheduled.

So, I spent the rest of the day reading webnovels, watched porn, ate out.
Basically turned the exam day into a cheat day.

When the time for exam came, my name was not in the final list, because I had earlier rejected an offer from
a company. So, that led me being banned from availing my dream oppurtunity.

Bruh, just remembered me writing that placement cell will prolly ban me. Did I just manifest it myself...🙂

I will be rich, jacked and will be enjoying my life. 😝, Manifest this world!!!!!!!!!

Rest of the day I spent working on college project, cussing out the placement office. Mostly cussing out the placement office.
Also had a video call with my friend from school after a long time. They are doing good.

Afterwards, worked on college project using react bootstrap and chat-gpt.

Before sleeping had a nice conversation with a friend, talking about my problems and how we wanna meet and hang out.
Told'em all about my problems and how me will stop being stubborn if I take another cheat day and add one rest day.

Since I am learning spanish, I was also given the great idea of watching Money Heist and Berlin. So, will probably get some
proficiency in and then watch the shows. That'll be fun.
Then went to sleep.

That's all. Adios blog 👋
