This is combined blog of 31 and 31st January. Both of these days, I did nothing in regards of studying.
My nose was blocked and they were the last 2 days of the month, so I gave in to my mind and just did some rest,
read webnovels and hung(? is it the right word) around with my friends.

On 31st of Jan, I did not even feel like going to the gym, but my friend called and I was like I will just go meet them,
tell them I am sick and then go drink hot tea in the morning. That's why I just went in my cargo pants.

Somehow that turned to me working out in my cargoes only ðŸ™ƒ. Seeing my friends working out, I also started and just like that
had a nice gym session.

On 30th, after the gym session, we saw the finals of girl's basketball, that was happening in the morning, and after that when the court
got empty, just played around with my friends.

Well, these 2 days were cheat days. That's all I will say.

Also, somehow one month is already over. Sometimes, I feel like time is going so fast.
So, from tomorrow new months new goals.

Adios blog ðŸ‘‹
