I am writing this on 4th of January.

Spent my morning hitting back at the gym. Tried deadlifting 80kg. Needless to say, my back hurts rn.
Afterwards slept. Then did some neetcode problems with the goal of doing for the next day also, so that I can focus
more on eCommmerce project.

That failed as I felt tired which gave me the excuse to slack of and that's what I did then.

Bad performance. Expected more from me.
