Yoii, so yesterday I woke up around 7:30 am and went to gym at 7:40 am.
Hit back and shoulders yesterday.

For back really went heavy on lat pulldowns. My back workout is pretty sorted, all machines only.
I really like using machines instead of bodyweight exercises as I can gradually move my way up weights.
So, you can really see your progress and not only because I am a pussy and can't do pull-ups and push-ups.

It's not like I haven't tried doing pull-ups. There is some mobility issue with my left shoulder, it locks out and
then I can't lift myself back up during pull-ups.

Yeah, so as I was saying machines are nice, you can slowly see yourself level up.

Also, in shoulders I was able to do shoulder press with 22.5kg dumbbells, so progressss 🕺

After that went straight to my laptop, drank protein and ate 3 eggs out of 4, gave one to my roomie.

Coded and worked on integrating app with backend. Now, only 2 major things are left, authentication and payment integration, which will
hopefully be done on 19.

In the evening, again went out and ate pani puri and also talked to my school friend after a long time. She talked about how she went out to
so many places in her city only. She also knows how to drive a car and I am still not comfortable taking bike to a crowded market 😭

After coming back to my room, went back to coding. After some time my roomie and friend came and just talked about things in general.
My friend, let's call this one overachiever, is really good at the stuff he puts his focus on. He is like really good at coding, development and
problem-solving skills. But he's been having really bad luck, due to how the job's market been and is not getting the chance to interview at
the large companies. He is like what I aspire to become, like he's really good at all stuff software. He recently entered a relationship and
he's already in love and thinking about- let's just not write stuff about my friend here.

Yeah, so I hope I will reach the same level of competence he has.
Sayonara, blog 👋
