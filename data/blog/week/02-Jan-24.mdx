## Goals

1. React native eCommerce
2. Cohort up to date
3. Excel sheets for all the problems that I solved/attempted in the first week.

### Start of Week:

For this week ideally, I will use 3 days for eCommerce, 3 days for cohort and 1 day for any unforeseen circumstances.
I have decided that from this week onwards first I will attempt the daily problem, puzzle and sql query and only after that
start up on other things/tasks of the day.

### End of week:

I would say falling into a routine is still in progress. I just need to keep in mind to not sleep in the afternoon, and to not open youtube shorts!

Revising punjabi is going good. Just need to regularly read some punjabi sentences to be able to become fluent in reading punjabi.

I did complete the nextJS tutorial, so that is good, but there are still many aspects of nextJS I am not knowledgeable about.
Apart from that I also started exploring react native, so that went well.

4. and 5. I know that these should be the top priority after nextJS commerce but I was still not able to complete these goals.

I am thinking for the next week, I will complete all eCommerce app and website stuff and along with that get up to date on the cohort that I have decided to complete
but still have many topics pending.

I also did not give myself enough time to solve all leetcode daily problems and for the last 2 day just submitted the solution after understanding it. Will not follow this
bad practice going forward in the next week.
