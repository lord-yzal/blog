## End of the month

Yo, so just like that one month has already passed by.
Let's see this month, first of all I don't get how it passed by in a flash.

This month started with me following my routine, but then that broke down since I started focussing more on building an e-commerce application.
That lead me to exploring NextJS, React Native Expo, Typescript. I learnt about zustand - a nice state management library, payment integration,
how to build android apps

I did some data structures problems but 10 days in, it lead to me just copy pasting the solution, so I broke that streak off. I do not want a false streak.

Apart from that I played in sports event of our college and lost 2 matches and won 1. It was bound to happen, since I had stopped playing so long ago.
Me managing to play the entire game was a feat in of itself, since my stamina is recently at top bottom. Whenever I talk about this, the excuse immediately comes afterwards.
"It's because running leads me to weight loss, and I am trying to put on some weight" 🙃

Apart from that, I completed the rookie section of spanish on duolingo. I also stopped reading punjabi, will continue that from next month

All notable events:

1. trip id card BE event happened 😂
2. Friend's Chaat treat.
3. Almost lost my wireless earphones in someone's room.
   Went shopping, bought a buy 2 get 1 type deal, and friend lost his token
   Japan company exam 🫠
   College basketball event
